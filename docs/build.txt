To build the program, you'll need to have a C++20 compatible compiler, such as
GCC (10+) or Clang (14+). I have not tested it on MSVC, but you can configure
the CMakeLists.txt to make it work on there too.

Unfortunately I didn't really design this to be simple. I do not have much experience
writing good, portable build configurations so this isn't intended to be 'simple', sorry.

To start off, you'll need to compile the glad file in the "./include/glad" directory and link
it as a static or shared library, whichever you prefer. You'll also need GLFW3 and SFML, make sure
you get the right versions as listed in the dependencies, otherwise it probably won't work.

I am not sure how to write a proper portable CMake configuration. It is a mess
right now at the moment. You'll probably have to edit some of the configurations  yourself. Sorry.
I would greatly appreciate any help in trying to make it better. 

Also, I have only tested the release build on Linux. But there is absolutely no reason why it wouldn't work
on Windows or MacOS. From the time I was using Windows, everything compiled well and fine. Uncertain
about MacOS, but I am fairly confident it should work there too.

Dependencies:
  SFML 2.5.1
  GLFW3 3.3.6
  GLAD (included in the source directory so you don't have to worry about finding the right version online)
