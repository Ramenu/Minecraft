Glm::Perspective(FOV, Viewport width/height, near plane, far plane)

The first parameter defines the FOV value, the second sets the aspect ratio, and the third and fourth parameter set the near and
far plane of the frustrum.

Model Matrix:
-------------
The model matrix consists of translations, scaling, or rotations
that we'd like to apply to all object's vertices to global world space.
