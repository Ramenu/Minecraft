CLASSIC V2.9
------------
- Significant rendering optimizations, most chunks that the player cannot see are not visible to the player
- Small world gen changes for plains biomes and tree generation
- Blocks can now be placed and breaked on every chunk


Some links to the libraries I use, they are really great, go check them out:<br>
https://www.glfw.org/ (Window and event handling library)<br>
https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad (Provides OpenGL loader generator, and more.)<br>
https://github.com/SFML/SFML (I use it for audio, but they support graphics, networks, and a whole lot of other stuff)<br>
https://github.com/kthohr/gcem (Compile-time math library)<br>
https://github.com/nothings/stb (For image processing)<br>

I'm also using other tools to help make the code look cleaner, and hopefully 'safer'. Hope you find them interesting:
https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck<br>
https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/<br>
https://drmemory.org/index.html<br>
https://valgrind.org<br>

The SFX does not belong to me, and is used for private purposes by me only. When the game is released,
I will add my own SFX.
