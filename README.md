This is an improved version of my original Minecraft clone I made a couple months ago, it doesn't have any new additions (yet) but I am planning to add more features later on. The main things that were changed was mainly just better file handling and organizing tasks into seperate subroutines to make it easier. Also, everything doesn't happen in the main function now. 

In general, it is much easier to navigate (I hope) and I also made it slightly more efficient, but probably not a significant one.

I will consider this the first or second version of the game, but as of right now, nothing hasn't been added that I didn't add already before. 

To sum up the current features though:
- Camera system with movement
- Grass block
- Keyboard input
- Added a Minecraft logo icon


Asides from the Minecraft icon, there is nothing new to this update.
