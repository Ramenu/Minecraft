CLASSIC V2.0
------------
- Face culling has been improved further (no blocks that the player cannot see will be rendered)
- Chunk visibility is now updated when the chunk has been modified
- Removed camera class as I felt it was unnecessary for the time being


Some links to the libraries I use, they are really great, go check them out:<br>
https://github.com/SFML/SFML (I use it for audio, but they support graphics, networks, and a whole lot of other stuff.)

I'm also using other tools to help make the code look cleaner, and hopefully 'safer'. Hope you find them interesting:
