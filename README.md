CLASSIC V2.1
------------
- Added block highlighting again, although the player cannot highlight blocks 
- Added Minecraft sounds to the repository (so now you can actually run the game), however these will be replaced in future updates
- fixed getBlockFunction as it didn't correctly get the block position before (now it does, and returns the index of the block as if it were in the chunk 3D-array)


Some links to the libraries I use, they are really great, go check them out:<br>
https://github.com/SFML/SFML (I use it for audio, but they support graphics, networks, and a whole lot of other stuff.)

I'm also using other tools to help make the code look cleaner, and hopefully 'safer'. Hope you find them interesting:
https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck<br>
https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/<br>

The SFX does not belong to me, and is used for private purposes by me only. When the game is released,
I will add my own SFX.

HOW TO BUILD:

> Coming soon...
