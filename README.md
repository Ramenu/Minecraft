CLASSIC V1.55
------------
- Nothing was actually added in terms of the game, just made the code easier and nice to read (hopefully)
- Added a new file 'vertexarray' for handling vertex array related stuff


KNOWN BUGS:
- There is an annoying bug where sometimes the ray will highlight two blocks instead of one. I am planning to fix this sometime in the future.
- Camera will make weird turns 
- Pressing 'Q' may enable wireframe mode really fast, which will cause it to go off and on (may depend on hardware platform)

Some links to the libraries I use, they are really great, go check them out:
https://github.com/SFML/SFML (I use it for audio, but they support graphics, networks, and a whole lot of other stuff.)

HOW TO BUILD:
-------------

Coming soon...
