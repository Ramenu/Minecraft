CLASSIC V1.5
------------
- Added block destroying functionality
- Added block placement functionality (cobblestone blocks), only on the y-axis though
- Added SFX for individual blocks, so whenever they are placed or destroyed by a player, a sound effect is played
- Changed the default Minecraft textures and added in my own (it was too difficult to find the classic Minecraft assets)


KNOWN BUGS:
- There is an annoying bug where sometimes the ray will highlight two blocks instead of one. I am planning to fix this sometime in the future.
- Camera will make weird turns 
- Pressing 'Q' may enable wireframe mode really fast, which will cause it to go off and on (may depend on hardware platform)

Some links to the libraries I use, they are really great, go check them out:
