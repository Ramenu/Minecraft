CLASSIC V2.4
------------
- Added block breaking again (Along with the corresponding block break sound being played once it is broken)
- Added block placing again (Along with the corresponding block placement sound being played once it is played, though you still can't place outside of the chunk bounds for now)


Some links to the libraries I use, they are really great, go check them out:<br>
https://www.glfw.org/ (Window and event handling library)<br>
https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad (Provides OpenGL loader generator, and more.)<br>
https://github.com/SFML/SFML (I use it for audio, but they support graphics, networks, and a whole lot of other stuff.)

I'm also using other tools to help make the code look cleaner, and hopefully 'safer'. Hope you find them interesting:
https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck<br>
https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/<br>
https://drmemory.org/index.html<br>

The SFX does not belong to me, and is used for private purposes by me only. When the game is released,
I will add my own SFX.

HOW TO BUILD:
