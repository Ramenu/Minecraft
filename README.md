CLASSIC V1.4
------------
- Added block highlighting functionality upon hovering cursor over block
- Chunk is now drawn instead of a single block

This took a lot of time, and yet the ray isn't as promising as I hoped. Still, I think it's pretty ok for what it is. Next update
will probably include block breaking and block placement, maybe even SFX. 

KNOWN BUGS:
- There is an annoying bug where sometimes the ray will highlight two blocks instead of one. I am planning to fix this sometime in the future.
- Camera will make weird turns
